# Exercise 7

[!IMPORTANT]
This exercise relies on other exercises, thus those exercises should
have their binary under the `bin` directory. See [build](../../README.md#build) section.

## Exercise 7a

**Check the idempotence of the '_closing−opening_' alternated filters
for a particular case, using the programs implemented in previous exercises:**

I have created a shell [script](exercise_07a.sh) that performs this exercise. To run it use:
```{sh}
bash exercise_07a.sh
```

## Exercise 7b

**Idem for the 'opening−closing' alternated filters**

Another shell [script](exercise_07b.sh) has been created:
```{sh}
bash exercise_07b.sh
```
