# Exercise 5

[!IMPORTANT]
This exercise relies on other exercises, thus those exercises should
have their binary under the `bin` directory. See [build](../../README.md#build) section.

## Exercise 5a

**Check the idempotence of openings for a particular case,
using the programs implemented in previous exercises:**

I have created a shell [script](exercise_05a.sh) that performs this exercise. To run it use:
```{sh}
bash exercise_05a.sh
```

## Exercise 5b

**Idem for closings**

Another shell [script](exercise_05b.sh) has been created:
```{sh}
bash exercise_05b.sh
```
